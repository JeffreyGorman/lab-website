## What We Do

We combine three disciplines to unlock biology's potential for materials chemistry:

**Synthetic Organic Chemistry** – Design and synthesise new semiconductor building blocks  
**DNA Nanotechnology** – Program biological assembly to create precise molecular architectures  
**Ultrafast Spectroscopy** – Measure quantum properties at the nanoscale

This unique combination lets us explore vast chemical space rapidly, identifying the next generation of materials for quantum sensors, LEDs, photovoltaics, and quantum information systems.

By programming DNA to assemble organic semiconductors with nanometer precision, we create libraries of thousands of quantum materials in parallel—accelerating discovery by a million-fold compared to traditional methods.
