## Harnessing Biology to Accelerate Quantum Materials Discovery

**The challenge:** Discovering new quantum/semiconductor materials is slow. Traditional chemistry tests one molecule at a time.

**Our approach:** Biology screens millions of variants simultaneously. We're working to harness this massive throughput for semiconductor discovery.

By programming DNA to assemble organic semiconductors with nanometer precision, we create libraries of thousands of quantum materials in parallel—accelerating discovery by a million-fold compared to traditional methods.

## What We Do

We combine three disciplines to unlock biology's potential for materials chemistry:

**Synthetic Organic Chemistry** – Design and synthesise new semiconductor building blocks  
**DNA Nanotechnology** – Program biological assembly to create precise molecular architectures  
**Ultrafast Spectroscopy** – Measure quantum properties at the nanoscale

This unique combination lets us explore vast chemical space rapidly, identifying the next generation of materials for quantum sensors, LEDs, photovoltaics, and quantum information systems.

## Why Biology Changes Everything

Traditional materials chemistry: **~100 compounds per year**  
Our DNA-programmed approach: **100,000+ variants tested in parallel**

Biology has evolved exquisite molecular control over billions of years. We're tapping into this untapped resource to revolutionise how we discover functional materials.
