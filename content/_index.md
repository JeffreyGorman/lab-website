***Ex***citonics and ***P***hotochemisty (ExP) Lab @ Durham

We are semiconductor and DNA chemists working at the intersection of: synthesis, chemical biology, and quantum information science & photophysics. Leveraging our expertise in synthetic organic dye chemistry, biological assembly, and pump-probe spectroscopy we develop high-throughput techniques to pioneer the next generation of quantum sensing materials.

*Our core mission is to accelerate the discovery of new materials and deepen our understanding of their nanoscale photophysics to create more efficient devices, including quantum sensors, LEDs, photovoltaics, and beyond. By leveraging the massive throughput of biology, we're going to deliver this faster.*

We are always excited to welcome talented and motivated individuals to our interdisciplinary team.
