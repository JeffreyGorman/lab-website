We are semiconductor (dye) and DNA chemists operating at the intersection of synthesis, chemical biology, and quantum information science. Our goal is to accelerate the discovery of quantum materials by combining synthetic organic chemistry with the massive throughput of biological systems.

## Quantum Materials Through DNA Assembly

We make organic qubits using photogenerated dye molecules, leveraging DNA self-assembly and synthetic chemistry to achieve sub-nm control over molecular interactions. This allows us to precisely engineer spin dynamics.

Our approach combines synthetic chemistry with DNA nanotechnology. By functionalising dyes with phosphoramidite groups, we install large aromatic systems directly onto DNA using solid-phase synthesis. This overcomes hydrophobicity and enables precise control of interactions.

## Applications

Our bio-inspired platform accelerates development of:
- Quantum sensors and quantum information systems
- High-efficiency LEDs and photovoltaics
- Molecular electronics with tunable exciton transport
