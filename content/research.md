## Harnessing Biology to Build Quantum Materials

We are semiconductor and DNA chemists operating at the intersection of synthesis, chemical biology, and quantum information science. Our mission: **accelerate the discovery of quantum materials by combining synthetic organic chemistry with the massive throughput of biological systems.**

## Quantum Materials Through DNA Assembly

We create organic spin centres from dye molecules. [By leveraging DNA](https://www.cell.com/chem/fulltext/S2451-9294(24)00116-5), we control their self-assembly with sub-nanometer precision over molecular interactions. [This enables us to precisely engineer spin dynamics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.2c13743) in ways impossible with traditional chemistry.

**Our approach:** We [synthetically install dyes with phosphoramidite groups](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.1c10241), allowing us to incorporate large aromatic systems directly onto DNA using solid-phase synthesis. This overcomes hydrophobicity challenges and provides unprecedented control over intermolecular interactions.
